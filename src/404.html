  <h1 class="page-title">404: Page not found</h1>
  <p>Somehow you ended up on this page and yet.... there is nothing here.
    My best guess is that I renamed an article or a page and forgot to do a redirect (my bad).
    Second guess is that I wrote an article and then deleted it later because either a) the quality sucked or
    b) something caused me to reconsider the premise of the article.
    Want to keep trying to find the page? <a href="/">Head back home</a> to try to find it again.</p>
